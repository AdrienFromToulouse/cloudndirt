# Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to reference a maximum of knowledge related to infrastructure, architecture and best practices, primarily focusing on AWS.

All the notions, concepts, introduced here, will be as much as possible explained with detail.
The focus will be on making it an educational content first, hopefully targeting any levels.

The scope may naturally extend to other cloud providers or technologies following the dynamic of the contributions.

# Why that name?

The idea for the name was inspired by Gary Vaynerchuk with his concept of `Between the Clouds and the Dirt`. The base idea is that before talking or pondering or having an opinion on something by just reading the headlines, you better go back to your studies and practice and get to KNOW. Sort of acquiring mastery. Being as close as possible from the dirt, knowing the details in order to execute in a more efficient way and therefore shape the bigger picture, the cloud.

Let's personify those two entities.

## The Dirt

The hard work of understanding the common concepts and making them understandable by everyone wanting to start its journey in infrastructure architecture and deployment.
The practice to acquire those concepts leading to the KNOW.

## The Cloud

The application and deployment of the KNOW in a real environment and use cases, making it real and improvable.
